    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\"> Descriptive statistics provide simple summaries about the observations that have been made. Such summaries may be either quantitative or visual, i.e., summary statistics or simple-to-understand graphs. These summaries may either form the basis of the initial description of the data as part of a more extensive statistical analysis, or they may be sufficient in and of themselves for a particular investigation.Initially, when we get the data, instead of applying fancy algorithms and making some predictions, we first try to read and understand the data by applying statistical techniques.</div> \n",

    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\">We will root our discussion of statistics in real-world data taken from OECD.Stat homepage (https://stats.oecd.org/). In this notebook we describe an OECD (Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development) dataset containing data on average annual wages for full-time and full-year equivalent employees in the total economy. Average annual wages per full-time equivalent dependent employee are obtained by dividing the national-accounts-based total wage bill by the average number of employees in the total economy, which is then multiplied by the ratio of average usual weekly hours per full-time employee to average usually weekly hours for all employees.

    "    * **pandas** (<https://pandas.pydata.org/>)\n",

    "        * The official Python 2D and 3D plotting library for generating plots, histograms, power spectra, bar charts, errorcharts, scatterplots, etc., etc.\n",
